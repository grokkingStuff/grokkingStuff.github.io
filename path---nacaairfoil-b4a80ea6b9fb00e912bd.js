(Using Haskell!)</p>\n<h1>A brief history of the NACA airfoils</h1>\n<p>Before the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) developed the NACA series, airfoil design was based on past experience with known shapes and experimentation with modifications to those shapes.\nIn short, as long as lifting surfaces produced adequete lift, it was good to go.</p>\n<p>This methodology began to change in the early 1930s with the publishing of a NACA report entitled ”<a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091108.pdf">The Characteristics of 78 Related Airfoil Sections from Tests in the Variable Density Wind Tunnel</a>. Not all 78 airfoils were used but the report did give aircraft manufacturers a wide selection to choose from. In fact, some aircrafts still use NACA airfoils, more than half a century later!</p>\n<p>In this report, the authors noted that the two primary variables that determine whether an airfoil was successful or not were the slope of the airfoil mean camber line and the thickness distribution above and below this line. More about this in the explanation of the formula.</p>\n<h1>Airfoil Terminology</h1>\n<h2>Chord</h2>\n<h2>Span</h2>\n<h2>Parameters</h2>\n<h3>Fixed parametrs of the NACA Series and how they relate to the constants</h3>\n<h2>Formular Definition</h2>\n<h3>Camber Line</h3>\n<h3>Thickness Section</h3>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">halfThickness t x = 5*t*(firstTerm - secondTerm - thirdTerm + fourthTerm - fifthTerm)\n                where firstTerm = 0.2969*(sqrt x)\n                      secondTerm = 0.1260*(x)\n                      thirdTerm = 0.3516*(x*x)\n                      fourthTerm = 0.2843*(x*x*x)\n                      fifthTerm = 0.1015*(x*x*x*x)  \n                      -- trailing edge is open.

We're going to be generating our own NACA airfoil data from scratch! (Using Haskell!)

* A brief history of the NACA airfoils
Before the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) developed the NACA series, airfoil design was based on past experience with known shapes and experimentation with modifications to those shapes. 
In short, as long as lifting surfaces produced adequete lift, it was good to go.

This methodology began to change in the early 1930s with the publishing of a NACA report entitled "[[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091108.pdf][The Characteristics of 78 Related Airfoil Sections from Tests in the Variable Density Wind Tunnel]]. Not all 78 airfoils were used but the report did give aircraft manufacturers a wide selection to choose from. In fact, some aircrafts still use NACA airfoils, more than half a century later!

In this report, the authors noted that the two primary variables that determine whether an airfoil was successful or not were the slope of the airfoil mean camber line and the thickness distribution above and below this line. More about this in the explanation of the formula.


* Airfoil Terminology

** Chord
** Span
** Parameters
*** Fixed parametrs of the NACA Series and how they relate to the constants
** Formular Definition
*** Camber Line

*** Thickness Section
  #+NAME: halfThickness
  #+CAPTION: Half-Thickness Formula for NACA Airfoils
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle src/index.hs
  halfThickness t x = 5*t*(firstTerm - secondTerm - thirdTerm + fourthTerm - fifthTerm)
                  where firstTerm = 0.2969*(sqrt x)
                        secondTerm = 0.1260*(x)
                        thirdTerm = 0.3516*(x*x)
                        fourthTerm = 0.2843*(x*x*x)
                        fifthTerm = 0.1015*(x*x*x*x)  
                        -- trailing edge is open. Use 0.1036 otherwise

 - Where did these arbitrary constants come from?

   So the NACA report we mentioned earlier found that the most successful airfoils were similar to the Gottingen airfoils & Clark Y Airfoils created earlier. These constants make the equation follow the curve of the original airfoils as much as possible.


* Types of NACA Airfoils
** Four figure Airfoils
** Five figure Airfoils
** Extension to Four & Five Figure Airfoils
** Extension of the NACA Series by the DVL
** Extensions of the NACA Series with regard to the Pressure Distribution & Laminar Profiles
*** Series 1 to 6 
*** Series 7 & 8

* Distribution of points and why it matters
** Curvature Distribution of Linear Distribution
** Cosine Distribution 
** Curvature Distribution of Cosine Distribution

* Code to parse from the command line
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle src/index.hs
 upperYPointsGen xPoints t = map (halfThickness t) xPoints
 lowerYPointsGen xPoints t = map (halfThickness t) xPoints
